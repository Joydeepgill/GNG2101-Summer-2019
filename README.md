## Problem
Our client has Parkinsons disease and experiences hand tremors, which makes it difficult for him to use 
touchscreens. 

## Solution
Our group had to design a compact device which helps our client with hand tremors to use touch screens. 

## Designs

| *Stylus* | 

  Implementing a much thicker version of a stylus (see Figure 1 below) that is used by our client experiencing hand tremors. Many different styluses are out on the market nowadays (ie. Apple Pencil, Galaxy Note Pen, etc), however, they are all very thin in shape and form. This becomes troublesome when experiencing hand tremors since a thin stylus will not have much grip, so there is nothing to hold onto when the tremors take place. Making a much thicker stylus would provide a much better grip in this type of situation.

| *Stylus with Retracting Tip* |

  This design is inspired by mechanical pencils that have “unbreakable” tips. Normally, an inner tip made of non-conducting material extends beyond the outer layer. When the stylus’ tip is pressed against a surface and enough pressure is applied downwards, the tip retracts into the stylus. Then the conducting part on the outer layer makes contact with the screen. The inner tip immediately pops out when the downward pressure is released. Alternatively, this design can use a button on the side of the stylus to retract the tip.
