## Problem
Our client has Parkinsons disease and experiences hand tremors, which makes it difficult for him to use 
touchscreens. 

## Solution
Our group had to design a compact device which helps our client with hand tremors to use touch screens.

| *Stylus with Retracting Tip* |

  This design is inspired by mechanical pencils that have “unbreakable” tips. Normally, an inner tip made of non-conducting material extends beyond the outer layer. When the stylus’ tip is pressed against a surface and enough pressure is applied downwards, the tip retracts into the stylus. Then the conducting part on the outer layer makes contact with the screen. The inner tip immediately pops out when the downward pressure is released. Alternatively, this design can use a button on the side of the stylus to retract the tip.
